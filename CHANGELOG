1.4.2 - March 21, 2013
- Fix a bug where different methods calling the same Last.Fm API endpoint would
  be returned the same result from the cache. This behaviour is incorrect as
  each method maps the same HTTP response differently. Therefore, the mapping
  object supplied by each method is used in the generation of the cache
  signature to avoid this.
